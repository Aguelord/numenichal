# Numerical methods

In mechanical engineering, numerical methods are essential for solving complex problems that cannot be addressed analytically. These methods involve the use of algorithms and computational techniques to obtain approximate solutions to mathematical models. Numerical methods are widely used in various fields of mechanical engineering, including structural analysis, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and optimization.

There exist several numerical methods, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some of the most commonly used numerical methods in mechanical engineering include:

## Finite Element Method (FEM)
## Boundary Element Method (BEM)
## Finite Difference Method (FDM)
