Here is my personal GitHub page where where we'll talk about **numerical methods in mechanical engineering**, like *Finite or Boundary Elements Methods*, etc...

My name is *Adrien*. I went to a mechanical engineering school in France to begin my PhD in 2024 on *Boundary Elements Methods on Fracture Mechanics*. I'm here to share with you a lot of aspects of numerical methods for solid and fracture mechanics, including programming some code to solve a boundary condition problem, numerical implementation and computation, model reduction, etc...

*Everybody* can add to this repo to help me improve this GitHub page as this is open source :) Of course, you will need to have some knowledge about the different topics. In summary, you have to add something new to this project. 

> NB : I would like to emphasize the *pedagogical competence and vulgarization* of scientific knowledge to a large audience ; it is more important than everything. **You better be a excellent pedagogue than a pure theorist**.

> NB² : for my fellow math lovers, don't worry, we will not leave maths.

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
