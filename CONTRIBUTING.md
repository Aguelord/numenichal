## I Have a Question

If you have a question, make sure that you haven't found an existing topic in [Discussions](https://github.com/Aguelord/numenichal/discussions) and in the following paragraphs. If you can't find an answer there, please open a new discussion. We will be happy to help you. We are all learning together, and we are happy to help you. Your question may also help others in the future ; it can be about the course itself, the code, theorical aspects, a question about contributing, or anything else related to the project.

### I Want To Contribute
If you want to contribute, please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first. As you see, this project is open source and welcomes contributions from everyone, but you have to have some competence in one or more of the following topics :
- **Numerical methods and programming**, especially in the following fields.
- Applied mathematics, especially in the field of numerical methods and **functional analysis**
- **Mechanical, aeronautical, civil** or any other engineering field
- Other fields of physics may also be relevant, like **electromagnetism, thermodynamics**, etc. as they are also fields that are used by engineers.
- (If you have some historical knowledge or appetite about sciences and epistemology, it would be also great 👀)

As you see, the list is wide 🙂. The idea is that everybody can developp / add a subject about his topics, while maintaining a common framework with the rest of the project, especially the website. At the moment, the final product is **the website**.

### Reporting bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub, after checking that it hasn't already been reported in the [issues](https://github.com/Aguelord/numenichal/issues). It can be about some code that doesn't work, a problem with the website (a broken link, latex that doesn't render, etc).

### Conventions for contributing

#### Programming in Julia

Julia is a programming language that is easy to learn and use. Their marketing slogan is *"Looks like Python, runs like C++"*. See the [Julia documentation](https://julialang.org/) if you are not familiar with it. If you already know Python, you will find Julia pretty easy to learn, don't worry.

Code blocks are some notebook-like spaces for the vulgarisers to demonstrate the theorical aspects of one of the fields covered by the project. For example :

For this purpose, we will use the [Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org/) package, which is a notebook interface for Julia. For each notebook, you must export it to static HTML and put it in the [assets/notebooks](numenichal\assets\notebooks) folder.

#### Latex
