This is my personal GitHub page where where we'll talk about **numerical methods in mechanical engineering**, like *Finite or Boundary Elements Methods*, etc...

My name is *Adrien*. I went to a mechanical engineering school in France to begin my PhD in 2024 on *Boundary Elements Methods on Fracture Mechanics*. I'm here to share with you a lot of aspects of numerical methods for solid and fracture mechanics, including programming some code to solve a boundary condition problem, numerical implementation and computation, model reduction, etc...

*Everybody* can add to this repo to help me improve this GitHub page as this is open source :) Of course, you will need to have some knowledge about the different topics. In summary, you have to add something new to this project. 

> NB : I would like to emphasize the *pedagogical competence and vulgarization* of scientific knowledge to a large audience ; it is more important than everything. **You better be a excellent pedagogue than a pure theorist**.

> NBÂ² : for my fellow math lovers, don't worry, we will not leave maths.[^1]
